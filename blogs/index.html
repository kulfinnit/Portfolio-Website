            <h2>Why I Built This Portfolio</h2>
            <p><em>Posted July 2025</em></p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    I could’ve used a generic portfolio template. I could’ve
                    slapped together a Behance link or a GitHub profile and
                    called it a day. But nah — that’s not me. I wanted a digital
                    home that actually <strong>represents my journey</strong> as
                    a developer, designer, and creative builder.
                </p>

                <h4>Static Site, Dynamic Message</h4>
                <p>
                    This portfolio is a
                    <strong>static site hosted on GitHub Pages</strong>. Why
                    static? It’s fast, secure, and totally under my control. No
                    CMS overhead. No unexpected server downtime. Just pure,
                    clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — crafted by me, for me.
                </p>

                <h4>Built From Scratch — Because I Can</h4>
                <p>
                    Every element here is custom-coded. No templates, no site
                    builders, no shortcuts. I designed the layout, wrote the
                    logic, and optimized the SEO. This isn't just a showcase —
                    it’s proof that I know my stuff, front to back(end).
                </p>

                <h4>Focused on Projects That Matter</h4>
                <p>
                    I’ve worked on a bunch of things — games, utilities, backend
                    APIs, and UI experiments. But I didn’t just throw everything
                    on here. I handpicked the ones that actually reflect
                    <strong>my skills, creativity, and potential</strong>. Every
                    project card links to GitHub, so you can dive straight into
                    the code.
                </p>

                <h4>More Than Just Code</h4>
                <p>
                    Yeah, the site’s built well — but it also tells a story.
                    From the writing style to the visuals, I wanted the
                    portfolio to give off the exact energy I bring to every team
                    I’m a part of. Devs who know how to build, communicate, and
                    vibe? Rare. That’s what I’m about.
                </p>

                <hr />

                <h4>TL;DR</h4>
                <p>
                    I built this portfolio to be more than a resume. It’s a
                    <strong>tech flex</strong>, a personal project, and a
                    statement. I’m not just applying for jobs — I’m showing you
                    what I can bring to the table, before I even say a word.

            <h2>My Favorite Dev Tools</h2>
            <p><em>Posted July 2025</em></p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    I don’t believe in hoarding tools. I believe in
                    <strong>mastering a minimal setup</strong> that gets out of
                    the way and lets you build what matters. I’ve experimented
                    with stacks, editors, and CLI tweaks — but this combo is my
                    go-to.
                </p>

                <h4>VS Code – My Command Center</h4>
                <p>
                    Lightweight, extendable, and crazy fast. VS Code gives me
                    full control without dragging performance. I use a few
                    must-have extensions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prettier</strong> – auto-formats code the second
                        I hit save
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ESLint</strong> – keeps my JS clean and
                        consistent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GitLens</strong> – version control and blame
                        history made visual
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Live Server</strong> – one-click previews for
                        HTML/CSS work
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>ChatGPT + Copilot – AI That Gets Me</h4>
                <p>
                    I treat <strong>ChatGPT</strong> like a teammate who never
                    sleeps. Whether it's code snippets, architecture ideas, or
                    edge case debugging, it's saved me hours.
                    <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> handles the boring stuff —
                    loops, boilerplate, and repetitive syntax? Done.
                </p>

                <h4>Terminal Tools – My Speed Setup</h4>
                <p>
                    CLI is where I live when I’m in the zone. Here's what I use:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>zsh</strong> with <code>oh-my-zsh</code> for
                        themes and aliases
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>fzf</strong> – fuzzy file search that’s
                        lightning fast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>tmux</strong> – terminal multiplexing like a
                        boss
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>htop</strong> – clean system monitoring</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ncdu</strong> – file size explorer for freeing
                        up space
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>
                <p>
                    I also keep <strong>Postman</strong> around for API testing,
                    <strong>Figma</strong> for design collabs, and
                    <strong>Notion</strong> for brain dumping ideas.
                </p>

                <hr />

                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                <p>
                    I’m not obsessed with shiny tools — I’m obsessed with
                    <strong>flow</strong>. My stack helps me stay in it. Every
                    tool I use is there for a reason: to reduce friction, speed
                    things up, and keep me building.
